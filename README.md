# LottoGame
Game that calculates how long does it take to win the Lotto jackpot (school project)

Hi all! I am Seppo Hyv√§rinen, a 31 year old beginner programmer student and code enthusiast from Finland. This Java project is my first longer project in my Introduction to Programming course at TAMK University of Applied Sciences in Finland. The idea of the application is to count how long does it take to hit the jackpot in the Finnish Lotto game (pretty long apparently). The game is run from the command line, you can either enter the numbers (separated with spaces) straight from the cmd or just start the app and take it from there. You will have to choose 7 unique numbers between the range of 1-40. If you fail to enter a correct type of coupon in the cmd - don't worry the app won't crash but instead starts and then you can enter the numbers one by one.

I also made documentation for each class and method to show what are the classes and methods meant to do.

Here's a screenshot of the app in action displaying basic functionality and how the program handles input errors.

I had a lot of fun making this project, I hope you enjoy using it. For this application I created a variety of different classes and methods which are built so that they are (hopefully) useful outside this app as well. A lot of the methods are written without using the most advanced techniques (because I am a beginner programmer) to demonstrate my skills in creating methods with more basic Java language.
